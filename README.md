# aProjectAboutCabs

Citizen insecurity is complex, cabs are a real big source of crimes because of lack of strong regulation laws. This tools is build by users for users. We're going to regulate the entire taxis inside city using an straighforward mecanism of scoring, thus each vehicule offering a service will be scored by people.

All entire cab information will be available and can be found just with number plate, so any event about awkward experiences and, in worst cases, crimes will be registered for ever. This software system does not guarantee to reach a whole solution, it prevents criminal attempts having as aim to mitigate risks of kidnappings, robbery and rapes.
